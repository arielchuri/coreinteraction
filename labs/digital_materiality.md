# Lab: Digital Materiality

## Learning Objectives

This lab addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO2:** Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content
- **LO3:** Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design
- **LO6:** Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to interactive systems
- **LO9:** Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet.

## Lab Description

This workshop explores the unique materiality of digital design - how pixels, code, time, and interaction create experiences that are fundamentally different from print or physical design. We'll experiment with properties that only exist in digital space: animation, responsiveness, user input, randomness, and time-based change.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Explore CSS animations and transitions
- [ ] Experiment with hover states and interactive elements
- [ ] Create designs that respond to user behavior
- [ ] Use time-based changes in your designs
- [ ] Consider how digital materiality differs from print
- [ ] Explore the relationship between code and visual output
- [ ] Create at least 3 experimental digital "materials"

## Experimental Prompts

1. **Hover States:** Create a composition where elements reveal, transform, or reorganize on hover
2. **Time-Based:** Design something that changes over time without user input
3. **Interactive Typography:** Make text respond to cursor position or clicks
4. **Responsive Behavior:** Create a design that fundamentally changes at different screen sizes (not just scales)
5. **Randomness:** Incorporate random elements that make each page load unique

## What You'll Learn

- CSS animations and transitions
- Interactive states in web design
- How time affects digital design
- The unique properties of digital media
- Creating dynamic, responsive experiences

## Materials Needed

- Laptop
- Code editor
- Browser with developer tools
- Creative mindset ready to experiment

## Time

In-class activity (Week 10)

## Tips

- Don't aim for polish - aim for exploration
- Break things intentionally to see what happens
- Combine multiple properties for interesting effects
- Think about what's possible in digital that isn't in print
- Consider user agency and how interaction changes meaning
- Use the browser inspector to experiment with values

## Key CSS Properties to Explore

```css
/* Transitions */
transition: all 0.3s ease;

/* Animations */
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.5; }
}

/* Transforms */
transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.2);

/* Hover states */
:hover { }

/* Timing functions */
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
```

## Reflection Questions

- What properties are unique to digital design?
- How does interaction change the designer's role?
- What happens when users have agency in the design?
- How does time affect digital compositions?
- What can code do that hand-crafting cannot?
