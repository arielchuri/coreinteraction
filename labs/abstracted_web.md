## Lab Description

Reference layouts of a chosen category of website (social media, news, streaming, etc) and recreate the basic layout of five sites using CSS and HTML. Tie these bootlegs together with a home page explaining your process and concept.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Choose a category of websites (social media, news, streaming, e-commerce, etc.)
- [ ] Select 5 websites within that category to analyze
- [ ] Identify common layout patterns and UI elements
- [ ] Create simplified "bootleg" versions using HTML/CSS
- [ ] Focus on layout structure rather than exact visual replication
- [ ] Create an index page that links to all 5 recreations
- [ ] Write a brief explanation of patterns you discovered
- [ ] Ensure responsive behavior where appropriate

## What You'll Learn

- How to analyze existing website structures
- Common layout patterns in web design
- CSS layout techniques (flexbox, grid, positioning)
