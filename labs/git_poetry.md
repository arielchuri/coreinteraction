# Lab: Git Poetry

## Learning Objectives

This lab addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO1:** Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.
- **LO4:** Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.
- **LO10:** Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems

## Lab Description

In this lab, we will write a poem together in class. As a demonstration, I will write the first line of our poem, and using Git, commit and push it to a Github repo that we all have access to. We'll go around the room, with each consecutive person pulling the latest version of the code, adding a new line to the poem, and commit and pushing it to the repo so that the next person can continue our poem.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Clone the shared GitHub repository
- [ ] Pull the latest version of the poem
- [ ] Add one meaningful line to the collective poem
- [ ] Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
- [ ] Push your changes to the remote repository
- [ ] Observe and understand the collaborative workflow
- [ ] Troubleshoot any merge conflicts (if they arise)

## What You'll Learn

- Basic Git workflow (clone, pull, commit, push)
- Collaborative coding practices
- Version control concepts
- Working with GitHub repositories
- Handling merge conflicts

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your computer
- GitHub account created
- Text editor installed

## Materials Needed

- Laptop
- Internet connection
- Git installed
- GitHub account

## Time

In-class activity (Week 2)

## Commands You'll Use

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
git pull origin main
git add [filename]
git commit -m "Add line to poem"
git push origin main
```

## Tips

- Pull before you start editing to get the latest version
- Write clear commit messages
- Don't panic if you encounter a merge conflict - we'll work through it together
- Be creative with your line but consider the flow of the poem
