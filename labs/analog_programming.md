# Lab: Analog Programming

## Learning Objectives

This lab addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO1:** Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.
- **LO3:** Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design
- **LO9:** Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet.

## Lab Description

In this lab, we will try to answer the question "what is a program?" at its most fundamental level.

## Part 1

1. Create a design for a concert poster that is informative and also that you find visually compelling. It must include at least one original image and any information that you deem necessary.
2. Based on the questions like those posed above (but probably not limited to), in everyday language (and words, only), write a 'program' that allows someone to replicate your design. Pay attention to the text as well as the form of this program.
3. Print out your instructions.

## Part 2

1. Trade programs with a partner without showing them your design.
2. Using the program you've been given, create a new poster design
3. Present your designs side-by-side with your partner. Show your programs and explain the logic behind them. Where did your program run without 'errors'? Where did your program create an unexpected result? Consider how you will present all of this information.

## Discussion Questions

- How does a program enforce standards (rules) vs. facilitate expression (variables)?
- How will your partner get the assets required to complete the design (fonts, images)?
- What assumptions do we need to make about tools? Workspace? Software settings?
- How do you solve problems when the original designer isn't available?

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Create an original concert poster design
- [ ] Write clear, executable instructions for recreating your design
- [ ] Follow a partner's program to create their design
- [ ] Compare results and identify where the program succeeded or failed
- [ ] Participate in discussion about programming concepts
- [ ] Present your findings to the class

## Materials Needed

- Paper and drawing materials
- Printer access
- Design software (optional for Part 1)
