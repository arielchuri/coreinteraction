## Writing Good Commit Messages

### Good:

- "Fix navigation bug"
- "Update profile photo"

### Bad:

- "changes"
- "stuff"
- "asdfasdf"

**Tip:** Describe **what** you did and **why**.

## Common Issues

### "Can't push" or "Rejected"

**Solution:** Pull first, then push again

### "Merge conflict"

**Solution:** Don't panic! Ask your instructor

### "Can't find my repository"

**Solution:** Check [github.com/your-username](https://github.com/)

## For Class: Git Poetry Lab

When participating in the collaborative poetry activity:

1. **Clone** the shared repository (File → Clone Repository)
2. **Pull** to get the latest poem (Fetch origin → Pull)
3. **Edit** the poem file in your text editor
4. **Save** the file
5. **Commit** in GitHub Desktop ("Add my line to poem")
6. **Push** your changes
7. Wait for your turn, then **pull** again to see everyone's contributions!

## Quick Links

- Your GitHub profile: `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME`
- GitHub Desktop docs: [docs.github.com/en/desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop)
- Help: Ask your instructor or classmates first!

---

## Pro Tips

- **Commit often** – After each small task, not all at once
- **Pull before editing** – Get the latest version first
- **Save files before committing** – GitHub Desktop only sees saved changes
- **Check the "Changes" tab** – See exactly what you changed

**Remember:** It's okay to make mistakes! Git is designed to be safe. You can always undo, and your instructor can help if you get stuck.
