**Course Description**

Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as
a creative medium---as a way of making and exploring. The coursework
focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles
which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are
encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques,
ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects
designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it
applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a
learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical
and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.

**Course Outline**

**Unit 1 Week 1-4: Working methods**

The first segment of Core Interaction will focus on the tools and
concepts required for building interactive experiences. We'll use the
languages of the web because they're accessible and immediately open up
new modes of communication for designers, but the concepts will be
transferable to any screen-based or interactive media.

In weeks 1-4 we will focus on:

-   File management (naming, organization, file paths)
-   Setting up and starting a new project
-   Tools (code editor, inspector, git/github)
-   HTML/CSS basic concepts and syntax
-   Figma (components, prototyping, grids, canvas sizing)

Sample projects: *Interview, Expressive Text, All HTML*

**Unit 2 Week 5-8: Digital canvas**

In our second segment, we'll investigate how designing for the digital
canvas differs from other media. We will aim to understand the inherent
complexities and how to use them to create compelling digital
experiences.

In weeks 4-8 we will focus on:

-   Typography with HTML/CSS
-   CSS selectors (cascades, combining, parent/child, pseudo)
-   HTML structure (box model, dissecting a web page)
-   Layouting (position, float, flexbox, grid)
-   Designing for the digital canvas (how big is a browser?)

Sample projects: *Flags, 25 Variations*

**Unit 3 Week 9-11: Designing for interaction**

Thinking about a website as a series of linked pages, we'll take the
concepts we used to make individual web pages and apply them to larger
systems. We'll explore how our systems can be designed to flex, rather
than break, under a wide range of variables while still maintaining the
original intent of the design.

In weeks 6-9 we will focus on:

-   Multi-page systems
-   Programming basic user interactions (:hover, basic JS click, etc.)
-   Time-based design (interactive states, storyboarding, prototyping)
-   User models (entering and receiving data, user flows, UX patterns,
    ways of navigating)

Sample project: *Stories as Networks*

**Unit 4 Week 12-15: Networks**

Because a website lives in a larger network of apps, websites, devices,
and contexts, our final segment will explore how our website lives
online. We'll take the work we've done this semester and explore
self-publishing and making our work public by putting our work on the
internet.

In weeks 10-15 we will focus on:

-   Putting a website online (hosting, Github, custom domains)
-   Accessibility
-   Asset creation (video, image optimization, webGL)
-   Metadata (search, social)
-   Connecting to other web services

Sample project: *Living Collection*

**Learning Outcomes**

*By the end of the semester, students will be able to:\
*

1.  Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond
    to critique productively.
2.  Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and
    inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great
    design concepts)
3.  Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in
    interaction design, using incremental methods such as pro- totyping,
    user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.
4.  Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and
    realize it through coding.
5.  Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds
    of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including
    responsive websites and apps for mobile.
6.  Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to inter-
    active systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and
    create consistency.
7.  Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize
    your own work.
8.  Be able to archive and document work that is printed, on screen or
    time based in a reflective manner for learning portfolio.
9.  Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the
    internet.
10. Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and
    processes to realize interactive systems, particularly systems for
    dealing with unpredictable, variable, and ever-changing content.

**Sample Projects**

**Interview**

Partner up with one of your classmates. Interview your partner. Create a
series of linked web pages that introduces your assigned partner to the
class. Your project should consist of at least 10 individual pages, and
should reveal at least 10 facts about your partner, other than their
name.

**All HTML**

Create a series of 5 unique web pages which focus on one or two HTML
tags each (no CSS whatsoever, even inline.) The idea of this assignment
is to see how html tags look by default, and to use (or misuse) them in
an inventive way.

**Expressive Text**

Find or compose a piece of writing that can be experienced on a browser.
The length of the text should be approximately one printed page. The
text can be a poem, manifesto, quote, etc. Layout the text so the
experience of reading changes based on scrolling through it.

**Flags**

Vexillology is the study of flags. All flags have a shared visual
vocabulary (stars, stripes, crests, crosses) and there are specific
terms to describe these things. Flags are always of interest to
designers because they communicate a lot of meaning with very simple,
graphic forms. They're also a perfect thing to make with code. Most of
the lines are straight and most of the shapes are described with simple
geometry. Start by doing a little research on flags.

You will be given a set of flags. You will be using HTML/CSS to recreate
these flags with code. Research your assigned flags and do some planning
as to how they can be created. What size should they be? What elements
cannot be created using code (and how will you make them)?

You will display all of your flags on one page. What code can be reused
between your flags? Give special consideration to how you will present
your flags on a single page (and what additional code needs to be
written to accommodate that).

Rules: You may only use images for an Emblem or Charge.

**Stories as Networks**

Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentinian writer famous for his short stories
that deal with labyrinths, dreams, religion, and mathematical ideas
(particularly set theory concepts like infinity and cardinality). His
circuitous and meandering prose, full of allusions and vivid imagery, is
a good way to think about the web as a network that has many nodes and
many connections that continuously folds upon itself. It is the act of
navigating through this maze that brings meaning to the web experience.

Read all three short stories from The Maker (1960): "Parable of the
Palace", "Everything and Nothing", "His End and His Beginning".

Choose one story and set the text using HTML and CSS so that the reader
will not only be able to read the story but also experience your
interpretation of the story. You may use one page or multiple pages to
convey this experience. This experience will be viewed on both large and
small (mobile) screens. You should use no more than two typefaces.
Representational images are not allowed.

-   How does hyperlinking (internal and external) enhance the meaning of
    the story?
-   How does your interpretation of the story shape the way the
    information is presented?
-   Does the experience change when viewing the page on a larger or
    smaller surface area? If so, how?
-   Linearity versus non-linearity
-   Pay attention to typographic details: special characters, leading,
    words per line, etc.

**Living Collection**

With the use of the collection amassed in the previous part of the
class, you'll be designing and building a website to contain and display
that collection.

Keep in mind that you're not designing a fixed, unchanging website:
you're designing a system that can expand or contract to show this
collection as it changes. The design of your site should also in some
way reflect your design perspective, particularly what you've discovered
about your interests and working methods during this course.

Also, think about how your content---and design concepts related to this
content---will help you to give form to your site. Other questions to
consider: Does the design of the site somehow respond to new content?
Rather than being a neutral vessel, how can the design that you use to
organize your collec- tion change when the collection itself changes?
For example, do colors on the site change in response to the kind or
amount of content posted to the site? Does the arrangement of ele- ments
or the grid change? Does the site's navigation change to highlight the
most current content?

Minimum Requirements

-   Content Addition & Protocol Area(s): The site must contain a
-   "mobile-first" area that allows the user to understand the protocol
    used for the creation of the collection and to allow them to add to
    this collection, as well.
-   Collection Display Area(s): The site must contain an area (designed
    for larger screens) that allows the user to view your collection.

The process is as follows:

-   Create a hierarchy: What are the specific kinds of information that
    the site will contain/display? Which information should be more
    promi- nent? Less prominent? How can you give order/ structure to
    the information?
-   Create a User Flow: Map all of the screens/states of your site that
    shows what in- formation will be displayed, and how the user would
    navigate from one screen to another. You shouldn't be thinking of
    visual design at this point, just of how your site is organized and
    the way the user will move through it.
-   Wireframes / layouts: Create wireframes that show the structure of
    your site, and layouts that show how each screen will look. Show a
    full range of examples of the kind of content your site will
    contain, inter- active effects like hover states, and how the site
    will change in response to different content. How can you take
    advantage of differences in screen sizes?
-   Functional prototype: Using your layouts as your guide, build your
    site, test it, adjust the design and the code, and continue
    tweaking. You'll un- doubtedly encounter problems with the design
    that you didn't initially anticipate, which is why multiple
    iterations are crucial. Use the qualities and opportunities inherent
    in the web to your advantage: interactive cues, generation of page
    code using JS (i.e. not only static HTML/CSS), links to external
    sites, video and audio, and soliciting user input all can be used to
    create a powerful experience. Be sure to check your design de-
    cisions against your content and your intentions/goals to avoid
    going overboard. Carefully consider the site's form as it relates to
    the content.

**Alternative Projects**

**Text Bot**

Create an input field that accepts a string of text and provides the
user with an output whose design changes in response to different
values/combinations of each input. Use a combination of HTML, CSS, and
JS to create a form that generates a results page whose design changes
with different inputs. JS will be used to generate HTML and CSS so that
the page's design and content are generated dynamically (this is
especially useful for sites whose content is in constant flux or is so
voluminous that it would be impractical to store static pages for each
possible state). This should be a compelling interactive experience, and
consider the site's beginning and end, the arc of the narrative, and the
formal beauty of the result. The experience should be engaging enough to
make us want to try many different combinations to see how the design
changes. The experience may be optimized for larger/smaller screens or
both.

**Parasite**

Information on the web is constantly being mediated and interrupted by
ads, web applications, gateways, and portals. These components
necessarily alter the way we experience information online.

Create a bookmarklet that mediates the experience of browsing on the
web.

Make use of JS functions

Is your tool a gateway or is your app/site an invisible actor?

How will your tool alter the social implications of the site?

How do you harness the power of confusion?

How do physical techniques like bricolage, collage, graffiti,
overprinting, etc. factor into your design?

**Sample Exercises**

**Analog Programming**

In this assignment, we will try to answer the question "what is a
program?" at its most fundamental level.

Part 1:

1.  Create a design for a concert poster that is inform- ative and also
    that you find visually compelling. It must in- clude at least one
    original image and any information that you deem necessary.
2.  Based on the questions like those posed above (but probably not
    limited to), in everyday language (and words, only), write a
    'program' that allows someone to replicate your design. Pay
    attention to the text as well as the form of this program.
3.  Print out your instructions.

Part 2

1.  Trade programs with a partner without showing them your design.
2.  Using the program you've been given, create a new poster design
3.  Present your designs side-by-side with your partner. Show your
    programs and explain the logic behind them. Where did your program
    run without 'errors'? Where did your program create an unexpected
    result? Consider how you will present all of this information.

Discussion

-- How does a program enforce standards (rules) vs. facilitate
expression (variables)?

-- How will your partner get the assets required to com- plete the
design (fonts, images)?

-- What assumptions do we need to make about tools? Workspace? Software
settings?

-- How do you solve problems when the original design- er isn't
available?

**Git Poetry**

In this assignment, we will write a poem together in class. As a
demonstration, I will write the first line of our poem, and using Git,
commit and push it to a Github repo that we all have access to. We\'ll
go around the room, with each consecutive person pulling the latest
version of the code, adding a new line to the poem, and commit and
pushing it to the repo so that the next person can continue our poem.

**Abstracted Web**

Reference layouts of a chosen category of website(social media, news,
streaming, etc) and recreate the basic layout of five sites using CSS
and HTML. Tie these bootlegs together with a home page explaining your
process and concept.
