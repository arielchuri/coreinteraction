## CLASS TIMELINE (160 minutes total)

### 4:00-4:05 | Setup & Early Arrivals (5 min)
- Arrive 10 min early to set up
- Greet students as they arrive
- Make mental connections: face → name → intro post detail

### 4:05-4:15 | Welcome & Roll Call (10 min)
**Take attendance** (mark late arrivals after this point)

**Roll call strategy:**
- Call each name and ask for pronunciation
- Make eye contact
- Reference something from their intro post
  - *"Sam, right? You're interested in motion design!"*
  - *"Jordan, you did that interactive poetry project!"*

**Brief welcome:**
- Course overview (1-2 minutes)
- Acknowledge asynchronous work completed
- Preview today's agenda

---

### 4:15-4:35 | In-Person Introductions & Icebreaker (20 min)

**Quick round of live intros:**
- Name, pronouns
- One word to describe their relationship with code ("intimidated," "curious," "excited," etc.)
- One website they love (and why)

**This helps YOU:**
- Hear names again
- Understand coding comfort levels
- Make more connections

---

### 4:35-5:00 | Community Agreements Discussion (25 min)

**Collaborative agreement building:**

1. **Review key statements** (5 min):
   - Curricular Justice Acknowledgment
   - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Statement
   - Pronouns Statement

2. **Small group brainstorm** (10 min):
   - Break into groups of 3-4
   - "What do we need from each other to learn well?"
   - Write ideas on post-its or shared doc

3. **Share out & finalize** (10 min):
   - Each group shares 2-3 agreements
   - Create master list on board
   - Ensure coverage of:
     - Respect and active listening
     - Risk-taking and experimentation
     - Communication and attendance
     - Critique culture
     - Collaboration expectations

**Document final agreements** → add to Canvas

### 5:00-5:30 | Lecture: Computers, Files, and Networks (30 min)

**Key concepts to cover:**
- What is a computer? (input, processing, output)
- File systems and organization
- File naming conventions (lowercase, no spaces, descriptive)
- File paths (absolute vs. relative)
- How the web works (client/server, request/response)
- URLs and domains
- Brief history of the web

**Show examples:**
- Good vs. bad file naming
- File path examples
- Browser developer tools
- How to view source code on any website

**Link to their work:**
- Proper file organization is essential for web projects
- Understanding file paths helps with linking pages
- Knowing how the web works helps debug issues

---

### 5:30-5:40 | BREAK (10 min)

**During break:**
- Review intro posts again on laptop
- Quiz yourself on names
- Check in with any quiet students

---

### 5:40-6:15 | Lab: Analog Programming (35 min)

**Activity Overview:**
Students create instructions for making a concert poster, then trade instructions and try to follow someone else's.

**Part 1** (15 min):
1. Each student designs a concert poster (paper/digital)
2. Write step-by-step instructions for recreating their poster
3. Print/prepare instructions

**Part 2** (15 min):
1. Trade instructions with partner (don't show poster)
2. Follow partner's instructions
3. See what you get!

**Debrief** (5 min):
- Where did instructions work perfectly?
- Where did they fail?
- What assumptions did you make?
- How is this like programming?

**Connect to web development:**
- Programs need to be specific
- Computers are literal (unlike humans who can guess)
- Debugging is finding where instructions fail
- Variables vs. constants

### 6:15-6:35 | Lab: Git Poetry (20 min)

**Activity:**
- Create a shared GitHub repo
- Each student adds one line to a collaborative poem
- Practice: clone, pull, commit, push
- Experience version control in action

**Commands covered:**
```bash
git clone [url]
git pull origin main
git add [file]
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
```

**Tips:**
- Go slowly, one person at a time
- Explain each step
- Don't worry if there are merge conflicts (it's a learning moment!)
- Make it fun — the poem can be silly

**Connect to workflow:**
- This is how you'll submit assignments
- Version control tracks all changes
- Collaboration requires communication

**Preview Week 3:**
- HTML/CSS basic concepts
- HTML basics demo

**Final reminder:**
- Check Canvas and GitHub for updates
- Start Interview assignment
- Reach out if stuck!
