## Learning Student Names Strategy

### As Intro Posts Come In:
1. **Make a name sheet** with student photos from intro posts
2. **Note their background** — design, code experience, interests
3. **Create flashcards** (physical or digital):
   - Front: Student photo
   - Back: Name, pronouns, one memorable detail
4. **Look for patterns:**
   - Who has coding experience vs. design only?
   - Common interests or goals
   - Creative/interesting details that stand out
