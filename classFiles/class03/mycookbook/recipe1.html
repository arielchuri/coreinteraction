        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <strong>Building the Cake Sponges</strong>6g
        <ol>
            <li>Cream together the butter and 100g of sugar for 5-6 minutes or until light and fluffy</li>

            <li> Add the eggs yolks one at a one and mix completely before adding the next one.</li>

            <li> Add the baking powder and GMS</li>

            <li> With the mixer on low, add half the espresso followed by half the flour. Combine and then add the
                remaining espresso and flour. Mix until just combined.</li>

            <li> In a clean bowl, add the egg whites, 125g sugar and the salt.</li>
            >
            <li> Whisk until stiff peaks form in the meringue.</li>

            <li> Fold the meringue into the batter, a third at a time.</li>

            <li>Prepare two springform pans by greasing and flouring them.</li>

            <li>Split the batter evenly between the two.</li>
            color
            <li>Bake at 175C-180C for approximately 25 minutes or until the internal temperature is 96C.</li>

            <li>Cool completely before frosting.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Creating the Coffee Butter via Sous Vide</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine coffee and butter in vacuum bag</li>

            <li> Add some cutlery to the inside of the bag to prevent floating</li>

            <li>Cook sous vide at 90C for one hour</li>

            <li> Strain</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Making the Coffee Swiss Meringue Buttercream</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg whites, sugar and salt.</li>

            <li>Heat mixture over boiling water, while stirring continuously, until it reaches 85C</li>

            <li>Transfer to mixer and whisk on high for approximately 10 minutes, until meringue is stiff and shiny
                and only warm to the touch (32C)</li>

            <li>Keep the mixer running and slowly add the butter, approximately 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully
                combined.</li>

            <li>If not using immediately then refrigerate. Before using it should be brought back up to 20C-23C and
                whipped again.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Finally, Building the Cake</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread only a thin layer of frosting on the first tier of the cake</li>

            <li>Place the second tier on top</li>

            <li>Frost the top of the cake, and decorate as you see fit. Don't be too generous with the frosting as
                it can overpower the cake underneath.</li>
            <li> Garnish with Coffee Beans, if wanted.</li>
        </ol>
