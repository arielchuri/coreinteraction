## Course Description

Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as
a creative medium---as a way of making and exploring. The coursework
focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles
which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are
encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques,
ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects
designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it
applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a
learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical
and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.

## Course Outline

### Unit 1 Week 1-4: Working methods

The first segment of Core Interaction will focus on the tools and
concepts required for building interactive experiences. We'll use the
languages of the web because they're accessible and immediately open up
new modes of communication for designers, but the concepts will be
transferable to any screen-based or interactive media.

In weeks 1-4 we will focus on:

-   File management (naming, organization, file paths)
-   Setting up and starting a new project
-   Tools (code editor, inspector, git/github)
-   HTML/CSS basic concepts and syntax
-   Figma (components, prototyping, grids, canvas sizing)

### Unit 2 Week 5-8: Digital canvas

In our second segment, we'll investigate how designing for the digital
canvas differs from other media. We will aim to understand the inherent
complexities and how to use them to create compelling digital
experiences.

In weeks 4-8 we will focus on:

-   Typography with HTML/CSS
-   CSS selectors (cascades, combining, parent/child, pseudo)
-   HTML structure (box model, dissecting a web page)
-   Layouting (position, float, flexbox, grid)
-   Designing for the digital canvas (how big is a browser?)

### Unit 3 Week 9-11: Designing for interaction

Thinking about a website as a series of linked pages, we'll take the
concepts we used to make individual web pages and apply them to larger
systems. We'll explore how our systems can be designed to flex, rather
than break, under a wide range of variables while still maintaining the
original intent of the design.

In weeks 6-9 we will focus on:

-   Multi-page systems
-   Programming basic user interactions (:hover, basic JS click, etc.)
-   Time-based design (interactive states, storyboarding, prototyping)
-   User models (entering and receiving data, user flows, UX patterns,
    ways of navigating)

### Unit 4 Week 12-15: Networks

Because a website lives in a larger network of apps, websites, devices,
and contexts, our final segment will explore how our website lives
online. We'll take the work we've done this semester and explore
self-publishing and making our work public by putting our work on the
internet.

In weeks 10-15 we will focus on:

-   Putting a website online (hosting, Github, custom domains)
-   Accessibility
-   Asset creation (video, image optimization, webGL)
-   Metadata (search, social)
-   Connecting to other web services

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:\

1.  Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond
    to critique productively.
2.  Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and
    inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great
    design concepts)
3.  Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in
    interaction design, using incremental methods such as pro- totyping,
    user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.
4.  Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and
    realize it through coding.
5.  Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds
    of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including
    responsive websites and apps for mobile.
6.  Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to inter-
    active systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and
    create consistency.
7.  Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize
    your own work.
8.  Be able to archive and document work that is printed, on screen or
    time based in a reflective manner for learning portfolio.
9.  Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the
    internet.
10. Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and
    processes to realize interactive systems, particularly systems for
    dealing with unpredictable, variable, and ever-changing content.
