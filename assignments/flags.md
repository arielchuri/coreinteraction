# Flags

## Learning Objectives

This assignment addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO2:** Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content
- **LO4:** Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.
- **LO7:** Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize your own work.
- **LO10:** Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems

## Assignment Description

Vexillology is the study of flags. All flags have a shared visual vocabulary (stars, stripes, crests, crosses) and there are specific terms to describe these things. Flags are always of interest to designers because they communicate a lot of meaning with very simple, graphic forms. They're also a perfect thing to make with code. Most of the lines are straight and most of the shapes are described with simple geometry.

You will be given a set of flags. You will be using HTML/CSS to recreate these flags with code. Research your assigned flags and do some planning as to how they can be created. What size should they be? What elements cannot be created using code (and how will you make them)?

You will display all of your flags on one page. What code can be reused between your flags? Give special consideration to how you will present your flags on a single page (and what additional code needs to be written to accommodate that).

## Rules

You may only use images for an Emblem or Charge.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Research your assigned flags and their vexillological elements
- [ ] Plan your approach to recreating each flag with code
- [ ] Recreate all assigned flags using HTML/CSS
- [ ] Use images only for emblems or charges (if necessary)
- [ ] Display all flags on a single page
- [ ] Implement reusable CSS code where appropriate
- [ ] Design an effective presentation layout for the flag collection

## Due Date

**Week 7: Mar 23**

## Deliverables
