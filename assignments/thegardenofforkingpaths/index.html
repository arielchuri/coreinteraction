<h1>The Tyger</h1>
<p class="author source">By William Blake</p>

<p>
Tyger Tyger, burning bright, </br>
In the forests of the night; </br>
What immortal hand or eye, </br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</br>
</p>
<p>
In what distant deeps or skies. </br>
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?</br>
On what wings dare he aspire?</br>
What the hand, dare seize the fire?</br>
</p>
<p>
In what distant deeps or skies. </br>
And what shoulder, & what art,</br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?</br>
And when thy heart began to beat.</br>
What dread hand? & what dread feet?</br>
</p>
<p>
What the hammer? what the chain,</br>
In what furnace was thy brain?</br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp.</br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?</br>
</p>
<p>
When the stars threw down their spears </br>
And water&#8217;d heaven with their tears:</br>
Did he smile his work to see?</br>
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?</br>
</p>
<p>
Tyger Tyger burning bright,</br>
In the forests of the night:</br>
What immortal hand or eye,</br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</br>

  <h1>A Modest Proposal</h1>
        <p class="prose">
          It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel
          in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded
          with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all
          in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of
          being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their
          time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow
          up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country,
          to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.
          </p>
          
          <p class="prose">
          I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in
          the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of
          their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great
          additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and
          easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the
          commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set
          up for a preserver of the nation.
          </p>
          
          <p class="prose">
          But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
          children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take
          in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in
          effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the
          streets.
          </p>
          
          <p class="prose">
          As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
          important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors,
          I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a
          child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year,
          with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings,
          which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful
          occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to
          provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their
          parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their
          lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to
          the clothing of many thousands.
          </p>
          
          <p class="prose">
          There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent
          those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their
          bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent
          babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move
          tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.
