# 25 Variations

## Learning Objectives

This assignment addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO2:** Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content
- **LO3:** Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design
- **LO6:** Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to interactive systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and create consistency.
- **LO9:** Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet.

## Assignment Description

Choose a published poem, no more than about a printed page. You will be making 25 formal variations using this poem. Each variation will be a separate webpage. For each variation, you will focus on changing the poem's form through shifts in composition, typography, hierarchy, scale, and pacing. The poem's content must remain intact throughout all 25 variations.

This project is divided into 5 levels of increasingly looser constraints of 5 layouts each.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Select a published poem (approximately one page)
- [ ] Create 25 separate web pages, one for each variation
- [ ] Maintain the poem's original content across all variations
- [ ] Level 1 (Variations 1-5): Strict constraints
- [ ] Level 2 (Variations 6-10): Loosened constraints
- [ ] Level 3 (Variations 11-15): Moderate freedom
- [ ] Level 4 (Variations 16-20): Greater freedom
- [ ] Level 5 (Variations 21-25): Maximum creative freedom
- [ ] Explore composition, typography, hierarchy, scale, and pacing
- [ ] Create a navigation system between variations

## Due Date

**Week 9: Apr 6**

## Deliverables

- 25 HTML pages (one for each variation)
- CSS files for styling
- An index page with navigation to all variations
- Brief documentation explaining your constraint system and approach
- Submit via GitHub repository

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Quantity:** All 25 variations completed
- **Typography:** Sophisticated use of typographic variables
- **Iteration:** Clear progression through constraint levels
- **Creativity:** Diverse and inventive formal approaches
- **Technical execution:** Clean, well-structured code
- **Navigation:** Functional system for moving between variations
- **Concept:** Understanding of how form affects meaning
