# Stories as Networks

## Learning Objectives

This assignment addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO2:** Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content
- **LO3:** Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design
- **LO4:** Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.
- **LO5:** Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including responsive websites and apps for mobile.
- **LO6:** Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to interactive systems
- **LO7:** Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize your own work.

## Assignment Description

Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentinian writer famous for his short stories that deal with labyrinths, dreams, religion, and mathematical ideas (particularly set theory concepts like infinity and cardinality). His circuitous and meandering prose, full of allusions and vivid imagery, is a good way to think about the web as a network that has many nodes and many connections that continuously folds upon itself. It is the act of navigating through this maze that brings meaning to the web experience.

Read all three short stories from *The Maker* (1960): "Parable of the Palace", "Everything and Nothing", "His End and His Beginning".

Choose one story and set the text using HTML and CSS so that the reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story. You may use one page or multiple pages to convey this experience. This experience will be viewed on both large and small (mobile) screens. You should use no more than two typefaces. Representational images are not allowed.

## Questions to Consider

- How does hyperlinking (internal and external) enhance the meaning of the story?
- How does your interpretation of the story shape the way the information is presented?
- Does the experience change when viewing the page on a larger or smaller surface area? If so, how?
- Linearity versus non-linearity
- Pay attention to typographic details: special characters, leading, words per line, etc.
