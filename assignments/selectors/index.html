        <h2>Lady Lazarus</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">by Sylvia Plath</h3>
        <p>
          I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.<br>
          <strong>Whatever</strong> I see I swallow immediately<br>
          Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.<br>
          I am not cruel, only truthful‚<br>
          The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br>
          Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<br>
          It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<br>
          I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.<br>
          Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,<br>
          Searching my reaches for what she really is.<br>
          Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<br>
          I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.<br>
          She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<br>
          I am important to her. She comes and goes.<br>
          Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<br>
          In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<br>
          Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.
