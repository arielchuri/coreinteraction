          <p>
            I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.<br>
            Whatever I see I swallow immediately<br>
            Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.<br>
            I am not cruel, only truthful‚<br>
            The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br>
            Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<br>
            It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<br>
            I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.<br>
            Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,<br>
            Searching my reaches for what she really is.<br>
            Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<br>
            I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.<br>
            She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<br>
            I am important to her. She comes and goes.<br>
            Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<br>
            In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<br>
            Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.
