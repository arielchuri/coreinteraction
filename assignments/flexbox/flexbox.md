# Flexbox

Please begin by going over the [flex basics](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/).

This folder contains two HTML files. [index.html](index.html) shows some of the basic layout options available.

In [poems.html](poems.html) I have added some <divs> in order to layout the page using flexbox. Compare this file to the [original poems](../poems/index.html) file.
