# Flexbox

Please begin by going over the [flex basics](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/).

This folder contains two HTML files. [flexbox.html](https://arielchuri.github.io/coreinteraction/assignments/flexbox/flexbox.html) ([code](https://github.com/arielchuri/coreinteraction/blob/master/assignments/flexbox/flexbox.html)) shows some of the basic layout options available.

In [poems.html](https://arielchuri.github.io/coreinteraction/assignments/flexbox/poems.html) ([code](https://github.com/arielchuri/coreinteraction/blob/master/assignments/flexbox/poems.html)) I have added some <divs> and an additional stylesheet in order to layout the page using flexbox. Compare this file to the [original poems](https://github.com/arielchuri/coreinteraction/tree/master/assignments/poems) file.
