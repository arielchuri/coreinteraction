# Living Collection

## Learning Objectives

This assignment addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- **LO2:** Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content
- **LO3:** Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design
- **LO4:** Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.
- **LO5:** Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds of devices
- **LO8:** Be able to archive and document work that is printed, on screen or time based in a reflective manner for learning portfolio.
- **LO9:** Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet.
- **LO10:** Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems, particularly systems for dealing with unpredictable, variable, and ever-changing content.

## Assignment Description

With the use of the collection amassed in the previous part of the class, you'll be designing and building a website to contain and display that collection.

Keep in mind that you're not designing a fixed, unchanging website: you're designing a system that can expand or contract to show this collection as it changes. The design of your site should also in some way reflect your design perspective, particularly what you've discovered about your interests and working methods during this course.

Also, think about how your content—and design concepts related to this content—will help you to give form to your site. Other questions to consider: Does the design of the site somehow respond to new content? Rather than being a neutral vessel, how can the design that you use to organize your collection change when the collection itself changes? For example, do colors on the site change in response to the kind or amount of content posted to the site? Does the arrangement of elements or the grid change? Does the site's navigation change to highlight the most current content?

## Minimum Requirements

- **Content Addition & Protocol Area(s):** The site must contain a "mobile-first" area that allows the user to understand the protocol used for the creation of the collection and to allow them to add to this collection, as well.
- **Collection Display Area(s):** The site must contain an area (designed for larger screens) that allows the user to view your collection.

## Process

1. **Create a hierarchy:** What are the specific kinds of information that the site will contain/display? Which information should be more prominent? Less prominent? How can you give order/structure to the information?

2. **Create a User Flow:** Map all of the screens/states of your site that shows what information will be displayed, and how the user would navigate from one screen to another. You shouldn't be thinking of visual design at this point, just of how your site is organized and the way the user will move through it.

3. **Wireframes / layouts:** Create wireframes that show the structure of your site, and layouts that show how each screen will look. Show a full range of examples of the kind of content your site will contain, interactive effects like hover states, and how the site will change in response to different content. How can you take advantage of differences in screen sizes?

4. **Functional prototype:** Using your layouts as your guide, build your site, test it, adjust the design and the code, and continue tweaking. You'll undoubtedly encounter problems with the design that you didn't initially anticipate, which is why multiple iterations are crucial. Use the qualities and opportunities inherent in the web to your advantage: interactive cues, generation of page code using JS (i.e. not only static HTML/CSS), links to external sites, video and audio, and soliciting user input all can be used to create a powerful experience. Be sure to check your design decisions against your content and your intentions/goals to avoid going overboard. Carefully consider the site's form as it relates to the content.

## Assessable Tasks

- [ ] Define your collection protocol and criteria
- [ ] Create an information hierarchy for your collection
- [ ] Design user flows for both adding and viewing content
- [ ] Create wireframes for all major screens/states

- [ ] Design a collection display interface (optimized for larger screens)
- [ ] Implement responsive design across devices
- [ ] Build a system that can expand/contract with content
- [ ] Use JavaScript to generate dynamic content
- [ ] Consider how design responds to changing content
- [ ] Test and iterate on your design
